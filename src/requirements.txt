Create an application using either angular or react.

-Make sure it has a good example of routes.
-Have it be able to login, log out and protect a route.
-Make a register form with form validation.
-Then make sure you showcase your skills with animations.
-No backend necessary, you can fake the back end with a service hardcoding username and password.

Use common sense in case you have any questions. Be prepared to explain why you project was done that way.
Extra credit is welcome to show off your skills. Send the test back in however method you see fit.
